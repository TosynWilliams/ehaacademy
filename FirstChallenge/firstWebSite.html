            Infanta Marina
        </h1>
        <p>
            Her terrace was the sand <br>
            And the palms and the twilight. <br><br>
            
            She made of the motions of her wrist <br>
            The grandiose gestures <br>
            Of her thought. <br><br>
            
            The rumpling of the plumes <br>
            Of this creature of the evening <br>
            Came to be sleights of sails <br>
            Over the sea. <br><br>
            
            And thus she roamed <br>
            In the roamings of her fan, <br>
            Partaking of the sea, <br>
            And of the evening, <br>
            As they flowed around <br>
            And uttered their subsiding sound. <br>
        </p>
